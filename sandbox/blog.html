      <h2>2020.04 - Hackers &amp; Designers</h2>
      <p><a href="https://hackersanddesigners.nl">Hackers &amp; Designers</a> (H&amp;D) curated 11 statements for the first ever <span class="logo">WIN WIN</span> online. H&amp;D is a collective based in Amsterdam and focused on community building and education, as well as how technology is designed and functions in communal and societal contexts. The friendliness to experimental platforms in this framing, made H&amp;D a natural choice for the first pilot <span class="logo">WIN WIN</span>.</p>
      <p>The 11 statements curated by H&amp;D specifically for the participation of their cooperative members centered around the meta topic of collective functions. These functions execute on subjects such as hierarchics, project and collective based labor, membership, learning and unlearning, and collective goals.</p>
      <p>The discussion was hosted asynchronously online by <span class="logo">WIN WIN</span> for one week (2020.04.08 - 2020.04.15). All members of the H&amp;D collective received personal invitations, platform credentials, as well as <span class="logo">WIN WIN</span> currency to fuel the interaction on the platform.</p>
      <p>H&amp;D enjoyed 5 moments of cooperative consensus during the week.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A project can only be executed and decisions can only be made when all members agree and support it.</li>
        <li>The collective sees its role as a hosting initiative, however, members are students too, never facilitators only.</li>
        <li>The maintenance work of a collective needs to be distributed amongst all members.</li>
        <li>A collective needs to safeguard and sustain the independence of each individual member. Everyone should be given the space to pursue their own practice and projects.</li>
        <li>Any activity or project of the collective shall cater to experimentation, which means contingency â€“ the possibility of failure, bugs, errors, crashes and other setbacks need to be considered and embraced.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Many thanks to Hackers &amp; Designers for their openness and willingness to particpate and help with this first pilot discussion on the platform. The learnings from the experience on how to improve the platform for the coming pilots are extremely valuable, and some of the improvements have already found their way into the <span class="logo">WIN WIN</span> system.</p>
      <p>I'm very much looking forward to the future pilots, and hope to see the members of the H&amp;D cooperative participating further in future discussions.</p>
